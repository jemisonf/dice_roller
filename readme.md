# Shadowrun dice roller

This is the source repo for a static web app that generates shadowrun dice rolls. You can enter the size of the dice pool and a modifier to be applied to the final sum, and see the number of hits (5s or 6s rolled) and the sum of the rolls plus the modifier. Individual die results are also shown, with hits highlighted green and 1s highlighted red. Future releases may add support for calculating glitches.
